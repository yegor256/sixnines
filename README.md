[SixNines](https://www.sixnines.io) is a hosted service to validate
and prove availability of your web service and sites.

Read this blog post for more details:
[_SixNines.io, Your Website Availability Monitor_](http://www.yegor256.com/2017/04/25/sixnines.html).

The badge is available as:

```
https://www.sixnines.io/b/5fa8?style=flat&format=png
```

Here, the `style` parameter can be either `round` or `flat`.
The `format` parameter can be either `svg` (106x20) or `png` (424x80).

This is how you put it in your `README` (in Markdown):

```

```

The badge you see above works exactly like that.

  pings: Total amount of ping's we've done so far
  failures: Total amount of failed attempts
  state: Either "up" or "down"

  flipped: Epoch time of recent state change
  expires: Epoch time when it has to be pinged again
  log: Detailed log of the most recent failure
  favicon: URI of the favicon
sn-endpoints/unique: (index)
  id/H
sn-endpoints/hostnames: (index)
  active/H
  hostname/R
sn-endpoints/flips: (index)
  active/H
  flipped/R
sn-endpoints/expires: (index)
  active/H

```

The `sn-pings` table contains all recent pings:

```

  time/R: Epoch time of ping
  local: IP address where we were pinging from
  remote: IP address of the endpoint we reached

## How to contribute?

First, install
[Java 8+](https://java.com/en/download/),
[Maven 3.2+](https://maven.apache.org/),
[Ruby 2.3+](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/),
[Rubygems](https://rubygems.org/pages/download),
and
[Bundler](https://bundler.io/).
Then:

```bash
$ bundle update
$ bundle exec rake --quiet
```

The build has to be clean. If it's not, [submit an issue](https://github.com/zold-io/out/issues).

Then, make your changes, make sure the build is still clean,
and [submit a pull request](https://www.yegor256.com/2014/04/15/github-guidelines.html).

In order to run a single test:

```bash
$ bundle exec rake run
```

Then, in another terminal:

```bash
$ bundle exec ruby test/test_base.rb -n test_lists_flips
```

Then, if you want to test the UI, open `http://localhost:9292` in your browser,
and login, if necessary, by adding `?glogin=tester` to the URL.
